# Pair Matching Problem

- Input: **Distinct** Rational Numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
- For every such rational number, the algorithm ALG has to assign **R** (reject) and **A** (accept), on the basis of following:

- This is an online problem in the sense that, the input is received in sequential manner and the algorithm has to take irrevocable decisions.
- Hence, there will be cases when online algorithm makes wrong decisions.
